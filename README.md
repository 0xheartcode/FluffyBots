# FluffyBots
This README is a WIP.

Going to add a few bots I've built in the past as POC.

May be useful for daily operations.


## BNBChainBot
BNBChainBot features the `DemoBot.py` a simple bot I made to interact with the `pancakeswap v2` protocol via a bot interface. 
 
That's it, pretty self explanatory :)

Buy, sell, slippage and transfer along with more rudimentary functionality. One of my first gigs, hence why it's all one file.

More about possible commands here: [here](https://github.com/0xheartcode/FluffyBots/blob/1bd875ac24abc7cc60aa68bb53d181fe77be2647/BNBChainBot/DemoBot.py#L1735).
